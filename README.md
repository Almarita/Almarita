# Hey there 🙌🏻, I'm **Irene**
## An enthusiastic Junior Full-Stack Web Developer based in **Berlin**

With a background in Ethics and Philosophy education, I started learning programming as an **autodidact** after finding out how much fun coding is. I graduated from a 9 week full time Web Development **Bootcamp** in [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon "Le Wagon"). Now I'm looking forward to keep growing on the tech sector, transform ideas into reality and build a digital future that enhances the way we interact with technology and each other.
